# **E-Voting System üó≥Ô∏è**

## **üìå Project Overview**
The **E-Voting System** is a secure and transparent online voting platform built with **Python, Flask, and SQLAlchemy**. It ensures **anonymity, verification, and integrity** in digital elections by utilizing cryptographic techniques. The system supports **voter authentication, encrypted voting, digital signatures, and real-time vote tallying** while ensuring a secure and seamless voting experience.

---

## **üöÄ Features**
### **üîê Security Measures**
- **Public Key Cryptography (NaCl/TweetNaCl)** for vote security.
- **Voter Anonymity**: Each vote is hashed and cannot be linked to an individual voter.
- **Digital Signature Verification**: Votes are signed using the voter's public key and verified before counting.
- **Admin Authentication**: Only authorized admins can access voting results.
- **Session-Based Authentication**: Secure login/logout functionality.
- **Email Confirmation**: Voters receive an email confirmation after voting.
- **Immutable Vote Records**: Votes are stored securely in an in-memory structure to prevent tampering.

### **üéØ Functional Features**
- **User Registration & Authentication** via a login system.
- **Candidate Selection Interface** dynamically generated from `candidates.csv`.
- **Vote Encryption & Verification** using cryptographic keys.
- **Secure Vote Storage** to prevent unauthorized modifications.
- **Admin Panel for Viewing Vote Counts** securely.
- **Error Handling & Flash Messages** for user-friendly notifications.

## **üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup**

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/aj-king2507/E-voting-System.git
cd E-voting-System
```

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies**
Ensure you have **Python 3** installed, then install the required packages:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the Database**
The system uses **SQLite** as the database. To initialize it, run:
```sh
python -c "from evoting import db; db.create_all()"
```

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Server Locally**
Run the Flask application:
```sh
python evoting.py
```
Then, open **http://127.0.0.1:6555/** in your browser to access the voting system.

---

## **üåê Running the Server on a Remote IP**
If you want to deploy the server on a remote machine and access it from other devices, run Flask with:
```sh
python evoting.py --host=0.0.0.0 --port=6555
```
This makes the server accessible over the network using your machine‚Äôs IP address.

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Crypto.subtle & HTTP Restrictions**
The `crypto.subtle` API **only works over HTTPS or localhost**, meaning:
- It will **not** work if accessed using `http://your-remote-ip:6555/`.
- It **requires a secure HTTPS connection** to function remotely.

### **How to Fix This?**
1. **Use a Reverse Proxy with HTTPS (Recommended)**
   - Set up **Nginx** as a reverse proxy to serve your Flask app over HTTPS.
   - Obtain a free SSL certificate using **Let's Encrypt**.
   
2. **Use a Secure Tunnel (Alternative for Testing)**
   - Services like [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) allow you to create an HTTPS tunnel:
     ```sh
     ngrok http 6555
     ```
   - This will provide an HTTPS URL that works with `crypto.subtle`.

## **üñ•Ô∏è Usage Guide**
1. **User Login:** Voters log in via the `/` route.
2. **Vote Submission:** Voters select a candidate and submit their vote.
3. **Vote Encryption:** Each vote is cryptographically signed and verified.
4. **Admin Login:** Admin logs in via `/login` to view vote results.
5. **Voting List:** Admin can access `/voting_list` to see vote counts and verified votes.
6. **Confirmation Email:** Voters receive an email after submitting their vote.

---

## **üîë Security Implementation Details**
- **Digital Signatures**: Each vote is digitally signed with the voter's private key and verified with the public key.
- **Public Key Hashing**: Each voter's identity is anonymized using SHA-256 hashing.
- **Signature Validation**: Invalid signatures lead to vote rejection.
- **Session-Based Authentication**: Admins need to log in before accessing vote results.
- **File Protection**: `index.html` can be protected using file system permissions.

## **üõ°Ô∏è Deployment Instructions**
### **Deploy Using Gunicorn & Nginx (Linux Server)**
```sh
pip install gunicorn
sudo apt install nginx
```
Then, run Flask with Gunicorn:
```sh
gunicorn -w 4 -b 0.0.0.0:6555 evoting:app
```
Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy for security and HTTPS support.

### **Deploy on Heroku**
1. Install Heroku CLI.
2. Create a `Procfile`:
   ```sh
   web: gunicorn evoting:app
   ```
3. Deploy:
   ```sh
   heroku create
   git push heroku main
   ```

## **üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting & FAQs**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Error: `sqlite3.OperationalError: unable to open database file`**
- Make sure the database file exists in the correct location.
- Run `python -c "from evoting import db; db.create_all()"`.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Admin Can't Access Voting List?**
- Ensure you log in via `/login` with the correct admin credentials (`admin/admin`).
- Check if `session['logged_in']` is set correctly.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Email Confirmation Not Sending?**
- Verify your **EmailJS** configuration in `index.html`.
- Make sure the API key in `emailjs.init("KETXkj4v7fICTN4e_")` is correct.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ `crypto.subtle` Not Working on Remote IP?**
- **Solution**: Use HTTPS via **Nginx + Let's Encrypt** or **ngrok**.
- `crypto.subtle` requires a **secure HTTPS connection** to work properly.
